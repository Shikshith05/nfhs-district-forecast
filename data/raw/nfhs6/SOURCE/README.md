# NFHS-6 Provisional District-Level Data (India) — Independent Compilation

District-level indicators from India's **National Family Health Survey-6 (NFHS-6, 2023–24)**, parsed from the **official IIPS State and District Fact Sheet PDFs** into CSV format.

> ⚠️ **Provisional Data:** The NFHS-6 fact sheets used in this repository contain provisional results shared by IIPS on their official website.
This repository is an **independent, unofficial compilation** and is **not produced or endorsed by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).**

## What's included

* **35 NFHS-6 State/UT CSV files** covering all surveyed States/UTs
* **1 consolidated dataset:** `all_india_nfhs6_district.csv`
* Python scripts used for PDF parsing and consolidation

> **Note:** Manipur is not included because NFHS-6 did not conduct the survey there.

## Data source

The underlying data are published by the **International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai**, under the **Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India**, as PDF fact sheets.

The data in this repository are **parsed directly from those PDF fact sheets into CSV format**. No survey data were collected, generated, or independently estimated by this project.

## Provisional data notice

The NFHS-6 State/District Fact Sheets used for this compilation contain **provisional results**.

IIPS cautions users regarding the interpretation and comparison of some indicators, particularly where sample sizes are small.

Therefore, this repository should be treated as a **provisional, parsed representation of the published fact sheets** and not as the final NFHS-6 dataset.
